        <h2 class = "recipes-header" >Making the Meat Balls</h2>
        <p>Grab a large mixing bowl and add 1 pound of a beef and veal mixture. Season with salt and pepper, then crack in two eggs. Using your hands, mix everything together until well combined. 
            Gradually add Italian breadcrumbs, one cup at a time, until the mixture is moist but firm. This ensures the meatballs hold together in the sauce without falling apart. 
            If you need a sauce recipe, check out <a href="/home/bobmidnight/repos/odin-recipes/GJS.html">Grandpa G's Tomato Sauce</a>. Once mixed, shape the meat into balls and place them on a tray or plate that can fit in the fridge. Let them chill for an hour to set.
