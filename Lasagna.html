        <h4> Making your Lesagna</h3>
        <p>To make a classic lasagna, start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lightly greasing a deep baking dish with olive oil. Cook lasagna noodles in a large pot of boiling water until al dente, then drain and set them aside. Begin assembling the lasagna by placing a layer of noodles on the bottom of the baking dish, followed by a thin, even layer of tomato sauce and a sprinkle of shredded cheese. Repeat these layers until the dish is almost full. For the final layer, top with more sauce, a generous amount of cheese, and, if desired, a sprinkle of fresh basil or red pepper flakes. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 20 minutes. Let it cool slightly before serving. Enjoy your homemade lasagna!</p>
